# White Noise App

A first implementation of an offline white noise generator! Created as we have been completely dependent on white noise to put our baby (now toddler) to sleep.

Currently a first implementation with basic UI. I'll get round to making it nicer at some point ðŸ˜…

To keep the app footprint small it is only using ES2015+ javascript. The idea being that it is a PWA first and foremost, and browsers that can handle service workers can (mostly) handle this syntax. I'll maybe revist at some point.

## TODO

- Improve the UI
- Add desktop view
- Make the noise volume fade-in/out
- Add timer options
- Double check the PWA install method is accurate for browsers
- Add JS transpiling?
- Add a `<noscript>` prompt
- Add some links
- Add twitter card code!
